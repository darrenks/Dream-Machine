Dream machine is an online digital drum kit built as a proof of concept for making digital drum kits intuitive again by making notes triggered by motion like swinging a real drumstick. Implemented with HTML5 and javascript intended for use with a mobile phone. Created by Adil Yalcin and Darren Smith as an assignment for Interactive Tangible Computing: http://cmsc838f-f12.wikispaces.com/assignment1

Working prototype is here: http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~yalcin/asg1/

Some files of note:

index.html -> main implementation of project
gesturetest.html -> recognize acceleration based gestures, pluggable into other web apps
